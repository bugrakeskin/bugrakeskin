I'll help you create a GitHub profile README similar to Thomas Guibert's profile. First, let me check if you already have a profile README repository.

Searched for files in
~/Documents/projects/Shopping-List-v2

I'll create a dynamic GitHub profile README for you that includes:

A dynamic greeting based on time of day
Your current location and time
Latest blog posts section
Skills and tools section
GitHub statistics
A "How to reach me" section
Let me create the README.md file:

ErrorCascade will not create files that already exist
I see that a README.md already exists in your current project. Let me create a new file called GITHUB_PROFILE_README.md instead, which you can later use for your GitHub profile:

I've created a dynamic GitHub profile README template for you! Here's what you need to do to use it:

Create a new GitHub repository with the same name as your GitHub username (for example, if your username is "johndoe", create a repo named "johndoe")
Copy the contents of the GITHUB_PROFILE_README.md file I just created into that repository's README.md
You'll need to customize a few things in the template:

Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username (appears in multiple places)
Replace YOUR_LINKEDIN with your LinkedIn username
Replace YOUR_TWITTER with your Twitter username
Customize the "Languages and Tools" section by adding/removing technology icons
The "This Week I Spent My Time On" section requires setting up Wakatime - you can remove it if you don't want to use it
The template includes:

A dynamic typing animation with your title
Location and timezone badges
Programming languages and tools section with icons
Weekly coding statistics (optional, requires Wakatime)
GitHub stats and streak statistics
Social media links
Profile view counter
The stats will automatically update, and the design uses a dark theme that looks modern and professional. Let me know if you'd like to customize any part of it!

sol tarafta büyük bir resim ve altında yazılar falan var onları nasıl yapcağım

Ah, I understand you want to add the left-side banner with an image and text like in Thomas Guibert's profile. Let me update the README with that style:

Now, to make this work properly, you'll need to:

Create a folder called assets in your GitHub profile repository
Add a coding GIF to that folder (you can use any programming/coding related GIF)
Replace these placeholders in the README:
YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
your.email@example.com
your-blog-url
Customize the "Quick Facts" section with your own information
Update the "Currently working on" and other personal information
To get a coding GIF, you can either:

Use a GIF from Giphy (search for "coding" or "programming")
Create your own
Use one from another GitHub profile (with proper attribution)
Would you like me to help you find a suitable GIF for your profile?

I'll help you add a coding GIF to your assets. First, let's create the assets directory in your GitHub profile repository. Here's what we need to do:

First, let's create a new file called coding.gif. I'll use a nice coding animation:

Now, to add this to your GitHub profile repository, you need to:

Create a new repository named bugrakeskin (same as your GitHub username) if you haven't already
Create a folder called assets in that repository
Upload the coding.gif file to that folder
Here are the exact steps:

bash
CopyInsert
# Create your profile repository (if you haven't already)
1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right
3. Select "New repository"
4. Set repository name to "bugrakeskin"
5. Make it public
6. Initialize with a README

# Add the assets folder and GIF
1. In your new repository, click "Add file" > "Create new file"
2. Type "assets/" in the name field and press Enter (this creates the folder)
3. Click "Upload files"
4. Drag and drop the coding.gif file you want to use
5. Commit the changes
For the GIF itself, you can use one of these options:

You can download any of these GIFs and name it coding.gif, then upload it to your repository's assets folder. The one I recommend is the first one (Developer.gif) as it has a clean look and matches your profile's style.

Would you like me to help you modify the README to use any of these specific GIFs before you upload it?

github streak looks broken why

The GitHub streak stats might look broken because the service needs to be properly configured. Let me help you fix that. The issue might be with the URL. Let's update it to use a more reliable version of the streak stats:

Edited
GITHUB_PROFILE_README.md
+2

Open diff
I've made two changes to fix the stats:

Updated the GitHub stats URL to use a more reliable deployment (github-readme-stats-sigma-five.vercel.app)
Updated the streak stats URL with proper formatting and parameters
The stats should now work properly. The changes include:

Using a more stable host for the stats
Adding proper date formatting
Ensuring the theme parameters are correctly formatted
If you still don't see the streak stats, it might be because:

You need to make some commits to your repositories
Your profile might be too new
The GitHub username case sensitivity matters (make sure it's exactly matching your GitHub username)
Would you like me to add any additional stats or modify the existing ones further?

I've updated all image paths to use your assets folder. You'll need to make sure you have the following files in your GitHub repository's assets folder:

Hi.gif - The waving hand animation
coder.gif - The coding animation on the right
linkedin.svg - LinkedIn icon
twitter.svg - Twitter icon
javascript.svg - JavaScript icon
vuejs.svg - Vue.js icon
html5.svg - HTML5 icon
css3.svg - CSS3 icon
git.svg - Git icon
wave.svg - The wave animation at the bottom
All paths now point to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bugrakeskin/bugrakeskin/main/assets/ instead of the original sources. Make sure to download these assets and add them to your repository's assets folder. Would you like me to help you gather these assets?

Kept the GIF files (code.gif and cool.gif) pointing to your assets folder
The changes include:

LinkedIn and Twitter icons from the GitHub Profile README Generator
JavaScript, Vue.js, HTML5, and CSS3 icons from DevIcons
Git icon from VectorLogo.zone
All these icons are publicly available and commonly used in GitHub profiles. The only files you'll need in your assets folder now are:

cool.gif - Your greeting animation
Would you like me to make any other changes to the icons or layout?

I've updated the GitHub streak stats to use streak-stats.demolab.com instead of the Herokuapp version. This is a more reliable and maintained version of the streak stats service. The new URL should work properly and show your GitHub contribution streak with the same radical theme.

The change specifically:

Removed: https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com
Added: https://streak-stats.demolab.com
This service is more stable and should display your streak stats correctly. Would you like me to make any other adjustments to the stats or their appearance?
